# Kaggle-Deep-Learning
Use Google's Word2Vec for movie reviews.
It is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. 
Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. 
It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, 
but is computationally more efficient. This code focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis.
